## Introduction
This is a code repository for the **NBApplication**. 

In this application I focused on fetching the data from an API and handling the state with the help of Redux Toolkit. The user can check the details of his favorite team as well as the latest news from around the world. The current standings, last game results and the list of players are also available. For contact form I decided to use Herotofu.

Stack used for this project: React, Redux Toolkit, API, MUI, TailwindCSS

## Setup
- run ```npm i && npm start```
